# battleship-solitaire
Project made for my Advanced Algorithms class. Features 20+ puzzles, manual solving, and three different solving algorithms.

- Backtracking
- Backtracking with Forward Hint Checking
- Genetic Algorithms

Run main.py to start and select a .bs file inside 6x6, 8x8, 10x10, 15x15. You can read the bs files to see the format for creating your own puzzles (they're just JSON)
